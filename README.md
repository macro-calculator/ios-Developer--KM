Unfortunately there were technical difficulties working the back end. Trying to authenticate using OAuth and navigate the API with limited documentation left me to abandon the idea of using the server. With the limited time left after struggling with the API, I did what I could to implement all the functionality to the app to meet the MVP. If I had more time I believe I could have accomplished this however I fell short. I believe if circumstances would've been different and time less limited I could've created an app to be proud of and that went beyond the MVP.
